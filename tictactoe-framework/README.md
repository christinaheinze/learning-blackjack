# Coding session: TicTacToe

## Option 1: 

Try to learn the optimal strategy, e.g. by using an explore-exploit strategy. To this end, modify the function  `update\_strategy(self, num\_games)' in the Explore-Exploit Player Class or implement a player of your own. The frequency of updates can be modified.


## Option 2: 

Use the winning states to implement a value function. To this end, modify the function
`provide\_value(self, state, future\_state, winningpos)' in the Value-by-Hand Player Class.
